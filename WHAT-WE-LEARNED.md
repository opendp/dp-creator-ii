# What we learned

Even if it seems obvious in retrospect, what have we learned about Python Shiny in this project?

## Refactoring: values vs. reactive values

A couple times I've started with something as a plain value, and then realized I needed a reactive value. This gets confusing if there are merge conflicts, or if some variables are reactive, and some aren't.

Typing might help here. I've also wondered about naming conventions, but I haven't been sure whether the the reactive values or the plain values are the ones to flag.

## Reactive calcs feel redundant

It seems like the returned value would be the same, so I would like to compress something like this:
```python
@reactive.calc
def csv_fields_calc():
    return read_field_names(req(csv_path()))

@render.text
def csv_fields():
    return csv_fields_calc()
```
into:
```python
@reactive.calc
@render.text
def csv_fields():
    return read_field_names(req(csv_path()))
```
but that returns an error:
```
Renderer.__call__() missing 1 required positional argument: '_fn'
```

## No component testing

It feels like a gap in the library that there is no component testing. The only advice is to pull out testable logic from the server functions, and for the rest, use end-to-end tests: There's not a recommended way to test the ui+server interaction for just one component.

## Normal tooling doesn't work inside of app?

There are several bits of tooling that don't seem to work inside end-to-end app tests. My guess is that this isn't related to Shiny per se, but rather the ASGI framework: It's not running in the same process as pytest, so it's not surprising that the pytest process can't instrument this.
- [App code skipped by test coverage](https://github.com/opendp/dp-creator-ii/issues/18)
- [Mocks don't work inside app](https://github.com/opendp/dp-creator-ii/issues/119)
- `breakpoint()` doesn't work inside end-to-end tests. (A comparison might be made to debugging a React application: With React devtools in the browser, it's pretty easy!)

## You still need some webdev skills

I've had to tweak the CSS a few times:
- Adding margin to the page
- Overriding tricky bootstrap hover styling for tooltips
- Hiding elements of the slider that we didn't want (because we're using it for a logarithmic scale)

## R vs. Python / Express vs. Core

The different flavors of "Shiny" are a bit of nuissance when trying to find examples.
The maturity of Shiny for R means that the vast majority of the examples are for R, even with Python in the search. It would be nice if the docs site remembered that I only want to look at docs for Core.
