# DP Creator II

** Under Construction **

Building on what we've learned from [DP Creator](https://github.com/opendp/dpcreator), DP Creator II will offer:

- Easy installation with `pip install`
- Simplified single-user application design
- Streamlined workflow that doesn't assume familiarity with differential privacy
- Interactive visualization of privacy budget choices
- UI development in Python with [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/py/)
- Tracking of cumulative privacy consumption between sessions
